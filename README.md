# Background

This project is the result of a serie of 3 assignments from COMP310 taught by Oana Balmau in Winter2023. 

The tasks of the first assignment were to add multiple functionalities to the starter shell, such as set, echo, mkdir, cd, touch, ls. We also enhanced batch mode execution and added support for one-liners.

The task of the second assignment were to implement the scheduling infrastructure, extend the existing OS Shell syntax to create concurrent processes, and implement different scheduling policies for these concurrent processes.

The tasks for the 3rd assignment were to add scaffolding for paging, design and implement demand paging, and implement the LRU replacement policy in demand paging.

# Diclaimer

The code in this project is partly Professor Balmau's code, used as a starter code for our project.
Specifically, I did not implement the multithreading scheduler in this project.
